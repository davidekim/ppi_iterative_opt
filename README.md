# ppi_iterative_opt
Protein protein interaction iterative optimization strategy to improve Alphafold2 validation metrics

## Description
This script takes a single PDB file of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex design as input and will try to improve Alphafold2 structure prediction validation metrics for the complex by cycling through iterations of RFdiffusion (partial diffusion), Protein MPNN, and Alphafold2 while keeping the target chain fixed.

## Installation
You can clone this repo into a preferred destination directory by going to that directory and then running:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/davidekim/ppi_iterative_opt.git
~~~

Install RFdiffusion.
~~~
cd ppi_iterative_opt
git clone https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion.git
cd ..
~~~
Follow instructions to download the model weights into the rf_diffusion directory from https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion

Install Alphafold2 params.
~~~
cd ppi_iterative_opt/af2_initial_guess
mkdir params
cd params
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/alphafold/alphafold_params_2022-12-06.tar
tar -x alphafold_params_2022-12-06.tar
cd ../../
~~~

Open ppi_iterative_opt.py in a text editor and edit the configuration parameters to point to your RFDiffusion, Protein MPNN, and Alphafold2 installations.

Optional:
Install Rosetta if you want to design with disulfides.
